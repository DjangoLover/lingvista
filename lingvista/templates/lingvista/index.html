        <p>How many times you searched foreign words translations or definitions and couldn't remember after?</p>
        <p>Most of dictionary searches are one-off. The key idea of remembering knew words is to repeat them later.</p>
        <p>And here where lingvista comes.</p>

        Threre are only three steps that separate you from learning new words:
        <ol>
          <li>Sing up in our service with social account. By now we support <a href="{% url "social:begin" backend="github" %}"><i class="icon-github auth-icon"></i> GitHub</a>.</li>
          <li>Select your native language in <a href="">account settings</a>.</li>
          <li>Download our <a href="">Google Chrome Plugin</a></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Now every word you search will be stored in <a href="#">you searches</a>.</p>
